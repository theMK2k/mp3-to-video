# MP3 to Video

Convert mp3 files to mp4 video with a simple image generated from the filename.

## Usage

Feed a file as `--src` and it will be converted.

Feed a directory as `--src` and all the files within it will be converted.

Use `-v` or `--verbose` and you get some verbose logging.

Example:

```bash
node mp3-to-video.js --src /path/to/file/or/directory
```
